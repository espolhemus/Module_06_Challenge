Module 06 Challenge - WeatherPy

## Overview of Project
Module 6 Challenge. This project involves using Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and the CitiPy API, the OpenWeatherMAP API, and the Google Maps API to generate listings of random latitudes and longitudes, determine the city located closest to those coordinates, fetch the current weather for that city, and then plot those locations on a Google Maps layer, along with retrieving and plotting information about hotels nearest those locations, and plotting routes between cities using Google Maps.
